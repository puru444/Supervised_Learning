    "# Credit Risk Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge consists of the following subsections:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data \n",
    "\n",
    "### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the starter code notebook and then use it to complete the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the `lending_data.csv` data from the `Resources` folder into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the labels set (`y`)  from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (`X`) DataFrame from the remaining columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Note** A value of `0` in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of `1` means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check the balance of the labels variable (`y`) by using the `value_counts` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using `train_test_split`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Employ your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Calculate the accuracy score of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Generate a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Print the classification report.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice the small number of high-risk loan labels? Perhaps, a model that uses resampled data will perform better. You’ll thus resample the training data and then reevaluate the model. Specifically, you’ll use `RandomOverSampler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `RandomOverSampler` module from the imbalanced-learn library to resample the data. Be sure to confirm that the labels have an equal number of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the `LogisticRegression` classifier and the resampled data to fit the model and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Calculate the accuracy score of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Generate a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Print the classification report.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, you’ll write a brief report that includes a summary and an analysis of the performance of both machine learning models that you used in this challenge. You should write this report as the `README.md` file included in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure your report by using the report template that `Starter_Code.zip` includes, and make sure that it contains the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of both machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning models. Compare the two versions of the dataset predictions. Include your recommendation for the model to use, if any, on the original vs. the resampled data. If you don’t recommend either model, justify your reasoning."

    "**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings:**\n",
    "Following are the findings for the Classification Report of Original Prediction with Target Test (y_test) attribute: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy Score:** \n",
    "The Accuracy Score after considering TPs, FPs, TNs & FNs, we get the pretty high score of 0.95 i.e. 95% of accuracy in the performance of this Model. Therefore, the overall evaluation of this model states the accuracy level of 95% without breaking down at Risky & Non-Risky Loans levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy Score just calculates & signifies the overall confidence level of Model, and in this case when we run the Classification Report for Original Prediction with Target Test variable (y_test) it just shows that 95% accuracy rate of this Model nothing more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision Score:** \n",
    "The Precision Score is more precise than Accuracy Score for obvious reasons which is that it doesn't consider the Negatives and only focus on Positives (TPs & FPs) & particularly in this finding after considering TPs & FPs, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "FPs as High-Risk Loans (Value 1) was 0.85 (85%) with less confidence compared to its counterpart TPs as Healthy Loans with the reading of 1.00 (100%) i.e. the highest level of confidence in Model's Performance. Hence, the Precision Score determines the model's confidence in Healthy Loans is more as compare to Risky Loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall Score:**\n",
    "The purpose of Recall Score is to measure the True Judgements of Model, meaning we human knows that how many are True Positive Results & False Negative Results in total which the model has missed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after considering TPs & FNs we get:\n",
    "For Value 1, 0.91 (91%) for High-Risk Loans shows the Recall Score is quite high. Whereas for Value 0, 0.99 (99%) for Healthy Loans which is quite similar to Precision Score (100%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1 Score:**\n",
    "F1 Score is basically a Harmonic Mean, as a single summary statistic for the Precision and the Recall. Which actually computes after getting the Precision & Recall values and applying those values in this formula: 2 × (precision x recall) / (precision + recall). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after computing F1 Score we get:\n",
    "For Value 1, 0.88 (88%) for High-Risk Loans shows the F1 Score is actually somewhere in the middle of Precision & Recall Values. Where, the Precision was 85% & Recall was 91% we get the more refined value i.e. 88% after applying the F1 Score formula. Whereas for Value 0, 1.00 (100%) confidence at 3rd level of calculation after computing Precision, Recall & F1 proves that how solid the confifence is actually lies in Healthy Loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "The Model Performance has been measured or evaluated by applying confusion matrix in general where we have seen that the confidence for the Values 1 & 0 with following conclusion for each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Value 1 (High-Risk Loans):**\n",
    "The Value 1 in particular has been varied in different accuracy tests and we get the range of 85-91% (Precision & Recall) after applying the Precision & Recall techniques. Whereas, the F1 Score which is a Harmonic Value for the Risky Loans shows the best possible value lies witin the range i.e. 88%. \n",
    "\n",
    "This 88% shows the best possible value as the accuracy of this model after considering the TPs, FPs & FNs determining that how accurate the performance of this model is in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Value 0 (Healthy Loans):**\n",
    "The Value 0 shows the highest level of confidence in all 3 techniques: Precision: 100%, Recall: 99% & F1 Score: 100%. This shows that the confidence in measuring the Larger Class of Value 0 (Healthy Loans) is way too high. Machine may sound pretty confident at this level however this might get wrong in long run where machine model develops a tendency to favor Value 0 and give more precedence over Value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to avoid the unbiased behaviour we have a functionality called: Imbalanced Classes where we apply Resampling Techniques. Specifically, Oversampling is one the major technique will be leveraged for this purpose to artificially increase the size of Smaller Class so that the comparison with the Larger Class will be trated equal without getting biased, hence to get more fair results by eliminating error at fractional level.

    "\n",
    "**Accuracy Score:** \n",
